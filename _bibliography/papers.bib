This book gathers essays on artistic methods and ecological thinking developed as part of the Environment, Data, and Contamination research studio at the Academy of Fine Arts Helsinki.  
Led by Samir Bhowmik (University of the Arts, Helsinki) and Jussi Parikka (Aarhus University, Denmark), the studio explored alternative ways of engaging with “data” as materialized in specific landscapes and elemental media.

	abstract = {The idea of disobedient machines is developed from the perspective of the historical and current developments in artificial intelligence (AI). Disobedience is often used in arts and technology as both a theme and a tool. Beyond that, misbehaviour is presented as one of the skills that is indispensable for natural intelligence. The article doesn’t delve into the use of AIs as an assistive tool for creation. Instead, it speculates if AIs will afford the emergence of an independent, autonomous artificial creator. Different approaches to AIs are presented, from symbolism to emergism. The affordances of machine learning models are described, as well as their limitations like the incapacity to generate breakthroughs outside of their training data, their determinism, and the inability to use analogies to solve unseen problems. Other missing human (or biological) skills present in art are emotion, goal-less production, and agency, which is a problem even when human volition is studied. The limits of computational formalism are like the limits in mathematical reasoning – it always requires some external rules, or axioms demonstrated, like Gödel’s proof. Hofsdtader’s theory of consciousness proposes a way to conciliate the fact that human creativity is also based on closed, fixed biological rules. Finally, it is argued that a machine cannot be creative unless it is also able to misbehave. However, computers must follow a set of instructions or they stop functioning – that is the definition of a Turing machine. Hence, we must face the paradox of wanting well-behaved systems, with the limitations of symbolic machines, while at the same time demanding more autonomous, creative outputs. It is paramount to explore algorithmic misbehaviours that could circumvent this paradox for further development of AIs for the arts and society in general.},

abstract="Two interactive, non-linear, fictional, movie theater projects are described. The first, Ressaca, was released in 2008. A live-editing interface sits between the audience and the main screen. It is usually manipulated by the director, who creates a new improvised ordering of the sequences in each screening. The second one, Dispers{\~a}o, was not yet launched. The interaction device is provided by the mobile phones of the audience: viewers may use an app which simulates a social network used by the movie characters. The engagement of the audience will interfere with the unfolding of the story. Agencies, syuzhets and algorithms for both experiences are discussed. Finally the article locates these projects as belonging to the field of interactive digital narratives specific to the movie theater, and also part of poorly charted tradition of interactive media from developing countries.",

We detail the development of DCGAN, the deep learning neural network used in the show, from its cybernetics origin. The show and its creation process are described, identifying elements of creativity and technique, as well as question of the authorship of works. Then it frames these works in the context of generative art, pointing affinities and differences, and the issues of representing through procedures and abstractions. It describes the major breakthrough of neural network for technical images as the ability to represent categories through an abstraction, rather than images themselves. Finally, it tries to understand neural networks more as a tool for artists than an autonomous art creator.},

abstract = {This paper depicts a dialogue between art and technology, by examining coincidences and differences between artworks and inventions, their conditions and stakes. By examining these categories through the same lenses, this approach hopes to build bridges between the two, or even propose that they stop being seen as separate institutions.The text starts by looking at how the separation between art and science occurred in terms of etymology. It then builds upon the idea of skill, which is not far from art's original meaning. We look at how different they might be for science and art, in terms of intellectual and bodily skills.Since both fields have high stakes in originality and uniqueness, the paper looks into the issues of each one and the systems put in place by society to assure rights for artists and inventors.A turn towards knowledge as a raw material for art has been happening for a least a century, and was accelerated in the last decades by practices which incorporated several aspects of science and technology into the creative arts. To account for these practices, the categories of discrete art and invention art are proposed, and existing ones such as conceptual art are explored.The paper does not draw hard conclusions. It instead proposes a few leads to understand new stances within art and technology, and leaves the definition of knowledge art as an open concept.},

It describes experiences spanning from the first pioneering efforts to recent releases, including two of the author’s projects. It proposes a classification for these works in terms of algorithms for non-linear storytelling – branching, parallel and landscape narratives. It also proposes two classifications in their relation to a classic movie going experience: the collectiveness of the agency proposed (collective, representative and consensual/individual) and the intrusiveness of the input device (intrusive, familiar or immersive).},

I'm participating in two discussions around the exhibition Paradoxes of Photography in Helsinki: the <a href="https://research.tuni.fi/visualstudieslab/event/photographic-epistemologies-symposium-11-6-2022/">Photographic Epistemologies symposium</a> on June 11th and a discussion on Infrastructures of visuality at the Museum on June 10th, 4-6pm.

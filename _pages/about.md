I am a PhD candidate at the University of the Arts in Helsinki, investigating Artificial Intelligence and Visual Arts.

I teach related courses at Elisava Design School in Barcelona, where I am based. I develop projects with creative and social use of technology, and cooperate with non-profits such as <a href="https://coolab.org">Coolab</a>, <a href="https://laion.ai/">Laion.ai</a>, and <a href="https://getdweb.net">Dweb</a>.

I have created projects in a wide variety of supports such as mobile apps, installations and fiction feature films. I taught
in the Art and Technology School Oi Kabum! in Rio de Janeiro for 6 years, and run the Nuvem laboraroty for art and technology, in the countryside of Brasil, for 5 years.

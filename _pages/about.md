I am a PhD candidate at the University of the Arts in Helsinki, investigating Artificial Intelligence and Visual Arts.

I teach related courses at Elisava Design School in Barcelona, where I am based. I develop projects with creative and social use of technology like Erick 'A Dynamogram' and Coolab's server for community networks.

I have created projects in a wide variety of supports such as mobile apps, installations and fiction feature films. I taught
in the Art and Technology School Oi Kabum! in Rio de Janeiro for 6 years, and run the Nuvem space for art and technology, in the countryside of Brasil, for 5 years.


Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them.
